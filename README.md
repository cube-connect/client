# client

We created a basic working client-server UDP setup using ENet and defined the 
data types we'll be sending back and forth between the client and server.

Our next step is to:
1. Client: Figure out how to get a window up and running. And then using server
           data (potentially dummy data at first) and rendering that. Also
           need to install other packages. GLFW, GLM, etc.
2. Server: Looking at the cube_connect code and extracting what needs to go on
           the server. Use the drawing_snapshot.hpp to help figure that out.
